Getting your resume scored takes three steps. No account required.

## 1. Upload Your Resume

Go to the [Scanner](/scanner) page. Drag and drop a **PDF** or **DOCX** file, or click to browse. Your file is parsed entirely in the browser using a Web Worker.

:::tip
For best results, use a single-column PDF with standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills). Avoid tables, multi-column layouts, and heavy graphics.
:::

## 2. Add a Job Description (Optional)

For **targeted scoring**, paste the full job description text into the second input area. The AI will extract requirements (skills, experience level, education) and evaluate your resume against them.

Without a job description, you'll get a **general ATS readiness** score that evaluates formatting, structure, and keyword quality across all platforms.

## 3. Review Your Scores

You'll see individual scores from all 6 platforms:

- **Workday** (37% of Fortune 500)
- **Taleo** by Oracle (legacy enterprise)
- **iCIMS** (#1 ATS globally)
- **Greenhouse** (tech & startups)
- **Lever** by Employ (modern recruiting)
- **SuccessFactors** by SAP (13.4% of Fortune 500)

Each score includes:

- **Overall score** (0-100) with pass/fail indicator
- **Breakdown** across 5 dimensions (formatting, keywords, sections, experience, education)
- **Matched keywords** (green) and **missing keywords** (red)
- **Platform-specific suggestions** for improvement

## What's a Good Score?

| Score Range | Meaning                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 80-100      | Excellent. Should pass most automated filters.                 |
| 60-79       | Good. Minor improvements could help on stricter platforms.     |
| 40-59       | Needs work. Likely filtered out by Taleo and Workday.          |
| Below 40    | Major issues. Formatting or content problems across platforms. |
