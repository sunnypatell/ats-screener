Getting your resume scored takes three steps. Create a free account, then start scanning.

## 1. Upload Your Resume

Go to the [Scanner](/scanner) page and sign in with Google or email/password. Drag and drop a **PDF** or **DOCX** file, or click to browse. Your file is parsed entirely in the browser using a Web Worker.

:::tip
For best results, use a single-column PDF with standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills). Avoid tables, multi-column layouts, and heavy graphics.
:::

## 2. Add a Job Description (Optional)

For **targeted scoring**, paste the full job description text into the second input area. The AI will extract requirements (skills, experience level, education) and evaluate your resume against them.

Without a job description, you'll get a **general ATS readiness** score that evaluates formatting, structure, and keyword quality across all platforms.

## 3. Review Your Scores

You'll see individual scores from all 6 platforms:

- **Workday** (37% of Fortune 500)
- **Taleo** by Oracle (legacy enterprise)
- **iCIMS** (#1 ATS globally)
- **Greenhouse** (tech & startups)
- **Lever** by Employ (modern recruiting)
- **SuccessFactors** by SAP (13.4% of Fortune 500)

Each score includes:

- **Overall score** (0-100) with pass/fail indicator
- **Breakdown** across 5 dimensions (formatting, keywords, sections, experience, education)
- **Matched keywords** (green) and **missing keywords** (red)
- **Platform-specific suggestions** for improvement

Your scan history is saved automatically so you can track improvements over time.

## What's a Good Score?

| Score Range | Meaning                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 80-100      | Excellent. Should pass most automated filters.                 |
| 60-79       | Good. Minor improvements could help on stricter platforms.     |
| 40-59       | Needs work. Likely filtered out by Taleo and Workday.          |
| Below 40    | Major issues. Formatting or content problems across platforms. |

:::caution
Scores are approximations based on publicly documented platform behavior and community reports. They do not guarantee any specific outcome in actual application processes. This is an independent research project, not an official tool from any ATS vendor.
