| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Formatting           | 10%    | ALEX parser handles most formats |
| Keyword Match        | 30%    | Semantic matching is lenient     |
| Section Completeness | 15%    | Standard sections expected       |
| Experience Relevance | 30%    | Role Fit AI heavily weighs this  |

## Tips for iCIMS

1. **Focus on content quality** over formatting tricks. The parser handles most layouts.
2. **Use natural language** for achievements. The semantic matcher understands context.
3. **Quantify results** with specific metrics. Role Fit AI values measurable impact.
4. **Include skills in context**, not just in a skills section. "Built REST APIs with Node.js" > a bullet that just says "Node.js"
5. **Don't stress about exact keyword matching.** iCIMS understands synonyms and related terms.
