description: How Greenhouse's human-first approach and LLM-based parser evaluate resumes differently.
---

**Greenhouse** is the dominant ATS in tech and startups. Unlike most platforms, it does NOT auto-score or auto-reject candidates. It's built around structured human review with scorecards.

## Key Facts

| Attribute        | Value                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Vendor           | Greenhouse              |
| Market Share     | Tech & startups         |
| Parser           | LLM-based (most modern) |
| Keyword Strategy | Semantic (LLM-based)    |
| Strictness       | Low                     |
| Auto-Reject      | No (by design)          |

## Parsing Behavior

Greenhouse recently transitioned to an LLM-based parser:

- **Most modern parser** of any major ATS. Uses large language models for extraction.
- **Handles creative formats** better than any other platform. Tables, columns, and graphics don't break it.
- **Deep semantic understanding.** Can infer skills from context even if not explicitly listed.
- **No automated scoring or ranking.** Every resume gets human eyes.
- **Structured scorecards** are the primary evaluation mechanism. Interviewers rate candidates on predefined criteria.

## Scoring Weights

Since Greenhouse doesn't auto-score, our simulation reflects how well your resume presents to human reviewers using the platform:

| Dimension            | Weight | Why                         |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| Formatting           | 10%    | LLM parser handles anything |
| Keyword Match        | 20%    | Semantic, very forgiving    |
| Section Completeness | 15%    | Helps reviewers navigate    |
| Experience Relevance | 35%    | Humans focus on this        |
| Education            | 20%    | Reviewed manually           |

## Tips for Greenhouse

1. **Focus on storytelling.** Since humans review every resume, compelling narratives matter more than keyword stuffing.
2. **Quantify impact** with specific numbers. Reviewers using scorecards look for evidence.
3. **Tailor your summary/objective** to the company. Greenhouse reviewers read more carefully than automated systems.
4. **Creative formatting is okay** here (unlike Workday/Taleo), but don't overdo it.
5. **Highlight culture fit** signals. Greenhouse companies value team dynamics.

:::note
A low Greenhouse score from ATS Screener is less concerning than a low Taleo or Workday score. Greenhouse doesn't filter you out automatically. The score reflects how well-presented your resume is for human reviewers.
