## Parsing Behavior

Workday's parser is notoriously strict:

- **Headers and footers are skipped.** Don't put important info (name, contact) only in the header.
- **Tables and columns break parsing.** Stick to single-column, linear layouts.
- **Standard section headings required.** Use "Experience," "Education," "Skills" exactly.
- **DOCX slightly preferred** over PDF for parsing reliability.
- **Graphics, charts, and images are completely ignored.**

## Scoring Weights

Workday's scoring emphasizes keyword matching and formatting compliance:

| Dimension            | Weight | Why                                              |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Formatting           | 20%    | Strict parser means formatting issues are costly |
| Keyword Match        | 30%    | Primary ranking factor                           |
| Section Completeness | 15%    | Expects standard sections                        |
| Experience Relevance | 25%    | Quantified achievements valued                   |
| Education            | 10%    | Degree verification                              |

## Tips for Workday

1. **Use a single-column layout** with no tables, text boxes, or columns
2. **Put your name and contact info in the body**, not the header/footer
3. **Use standard section headings** ("Professional Experience," not "Where I've Worked")
4. **Mirror exact keywords** from the job posting
5. **Quantify achievements** ("Increased revenue by 23%" not "Improved revenue")
6. **Avoid creative formatting** like icons, progress bars, or skill charts
