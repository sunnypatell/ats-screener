title: Scoring Methodology
description: How ATS Screener calculates scores using research-backed platform profiles.
---

Every score in ATS Screener is generated by simulating how each platform's actual parsing engine, keyword matcher, and scoring algorithm would evaluate your resume.

## How Scores Are Generated

1. **Resume text is extracted** client-side from your PDF/DOCX
2. **Platform profiles are loaded** with researched weights and behaviors
3. **Gemini AI evaluates** the resume from each platform's perspective
4. **Scores are deterministic** per platform profile (same input = consistent scoring patterns)

## Platform Profiles

Each platform is modeled as a profile with specific characteristics:

```typescript
interface ATSProfile {
	name: string;
	vendor: string;
	parsingStrictness: number; // 0-1 scale
	keywordStrategy: 'exact' | 'fuzzy' | 'semantic';
	weights: {
		formatting: number;
		keywordMatch: number;
		sectionCompleteness: number;
		experienceRelevance: number;
		educationMatch: number;
	};
	requiredSections: string[];
	quirks: ATSQuirk[]; // platform-specific behaviors
}
```

## Score Calculation

The overall score for each platform is a weighted sum:

```
overallScore = (formatting × w₁) + (keywords × w₂) + (sections × w₃)
             + (experience × w₄) + (education × w₅)
```

Where `w₁` through `w₅` are platform-specific weights that sum to 1.0.

## General vs Targeted Mode

### General Mode

Without a job description, the AI evaluates:

- **Formatting**: How well the resume would parse through this platform's specific parser
- **Keywords**: Industry-standard terminology, action verbs, quantification quality
- **Sections**: Presence and structure of standard resume sections
- **Experience**: Quality of bullet points, quantified achievements, recency
- **Education**: Degree presence, field clarity, date formatting

### Targeted Mode

With a job description, keyword matching becomes the dominant factor:

- **Keywords**: Direct comparison between JD requirements and resume content
- **Experience**: Relevance to the specific role described in the JD
- **Education**: Match against stated education requirements
- Other dimensions remain the same

:::note
In targeted mode, platform-specific keyword strategies matter even more. Taleo's exact matching means you need the precise terms from the JD. Greenhouse's semantic matching is more forgiving.
