title: Pass/Fail Thresholds
description: How each platform determines whether a resume passes initial screening.
---

Each ATS platform has different filtering behaviors. Some auto-reject low scores, others don't filter at all.

## Threshold Table

| Platform           | Pass Threshold | Auto-Reject? | Rationale                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Taleo**          | 75             | Yes          | Strictest auto-scorer. Visible Req Rank %. Disqualification questions. |
| **Workday**        | 70             | Conditional  | Configurable knockout questions. HiredScore AI screening optional.     |
| **SuccessFactors** | 65             | Conditional  | Joule AI stack ranking. Moderate automated filtering.                  |
| **iCIMS**          | 60             | No           | Role Fit AI is advisory only. Humans make final decisions.             |
| **Greenhouse**     | 50             | No           | No automated filtering by design. Built for human review.              |
| **Lever**          | 50             | No           | No automated screening at all. Entirely search-dependent.              |

## What "Pass" Means

A "pass" indicator means your resume would likely survive initial automated screening on that platform. It does NOT mean:

- You'll get an interview
- Your resume is good enough for the specific role
- A human will be impressed by your qualifications

It means: **the ATS won't filter you out before a human sees your resume.**

## What "Fail" Means

A "fail" indicator means your resume has issues that would likely cause problems on that platform:

- **On Taleo**: Your resume may be auto-ranked below the cutoff or auto-rejected via disqualification rules
- **On Workday**: Your resume may fail to parse correctly or miss knockout question criteria
- **On SuccessFactors**: Your resume may be ranked low in the Joule AI stack

:::tip
If you fail on Taleo or Workday but pass on Greenhouse/Lever, it usually means your content is good but your formatting or keyword matching needs work for stricter platforms. Focus on exact keyword matching and clean formatting.
