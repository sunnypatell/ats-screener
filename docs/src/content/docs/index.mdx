## Why ATS Screener?

Built by [Sunny Patel](https://sunnypatel.net), a student who got tired of "free ATS checkers" that show you just enough to scare you, then paywall the actual results. Every one of them generates a meaningless score from arbitrary rules that have nothing to do with how real hiring systems work. ATS Screener is different: every score is backed by research into how each platform actually parses, filters, and ranks candidates. No paywalls, no premium tiers, just honest feedback so you know how your resume is actually being evaluated in today's hiring market.
